**Documentation Breakdown:**

- **Class**: `AverageCalculator`
  - Description: The `AverageCalculator` class calculates the average of elements in an array based on user input.

- **Method**: `calculateAverage(int n, int[] arr)`
  - Description: Calculates the average of elements in the given array.
  - Parameters:
    - `n` - The number of elements in the array.
    - `arr` - The array of integers containing the elements.
  - Returns: The average of elements in the array. Returns `0.0` if the array is empty.

- **Method**: `main(String[] args)`

This documentation provides a clear overview of the `AverageCalculator` class, its purpose, and how to use the `calculateAverage` method to compute the average of elements in an array. It also explains the usage of the `main` method for interactively prompting the user to enter array elements and displaying the calculated average. Comments within the code serve as inline documentation to explain the logic and flow of the program.
