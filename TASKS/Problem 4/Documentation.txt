### Documentation Explanation

- **Class**: `Factorial`
  - Description: The `Factorial` class provides a method to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.

- **Method**: `factorial(int n)`
  - Description: Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion.
  - Parameters:
    - `n` - The non-negative integer for which factorial is to be calculated.
  - Returns: The factorial of the given non-negative integer.
  - Throws:
    - `IllegalArgumentException` - If the input integer is negative.

- **Method**: `main(String[] args)`
  - Description: Main method to demonstrate the calculation of factorial using recursion.
  - Purpose: Prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer, calculates its factorial using the `factorial` method, and prints the result.
  - Parameters:
    - `args` - The command-line arguments (not used in this program).

### Documentation Breakdown

- The `Factorial` class encapsulates the factorial calculation logic with a recursive approach.
- The `factorial` method implements the factorial calculation using recursion, handling the base case (`0! = 1`).
- The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `factorial` method by prompting the user for input and displaying the computed factorial.
- Exception handling is used to handle negative input values gracefully.
- Detailed comments within the code explain the purpose of each method, describe their parameters and return values, and provide instructions for using the program.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and using the `Factorial` class, its methods, and how to interact with the program to calculate factorials of non-negative integers using recursion. The comments within the code ensure clarity and readability for developers using or modifying this code.
